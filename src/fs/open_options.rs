/// Options and flags which can be used to configure how a file is opened.
///
/// This builder exposes the ability to configure how a [`File`] is opened and
/// what operations are permitted on the open file. The [`File::open`] and
/// [`File::create`] methods are aliases for commonly used options using this
/// builder.
///
/// Generally speaking, when using `OpenOptions`, you'll first call
/// [`OpenOptions::new`], then chain calls to methods to set each option, then
/// call [`OpenOptions::open`], passing the path of the file you're trying to
/// open. This will give you a [`std::io::Result`] with a [`File`] inside that
/// you can further operate on.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Opening a file to read:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use completeio::fs::OpenOptions;
///
/// let file = OpenOptions::new().read(true).open("foo.txt").unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// Opening a file for both reading and writing, as well as creating it if it
/// doesn't exist:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use completeio::fs::OpenOptions;
///
/// let file = OpenOptions::new()
///     .read(true)
///     .write(true)
///     .create(true)
///     .open("foo.txt")
///     .unwrap();
/// ```
